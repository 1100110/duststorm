==========

Interactive books and Tutorials for the [D Programming Language](http://dlang.org).


Design
------

This site will utilize D to the fullest extent possible.
The software used will include:

* Vibe.d
* MongoDB
* Available Online (Most likely js) Text Editors

The site should use interactivepython.org as a 'guide'.  Note the quotes.
It is a functional website that does what we want, just for a different language.
Therefore we can almost compare ourselves 'apples to apples'

Be on the lookout for anything that is more difficult than it is on interactivepython:
Account Creation, Login, Navigation, etc.


Tutorials
---------

The format to be used:

* Markdown 

Unlike many other formats, Markdown provides a good compromise between 
plain-text and postprocessed text.  We will 'pretty-print' the text on page load,
as well as make it available for download.

Markdown also allows for embedded code snippets, which is very much what we want.

Interactive books and tutorials for the D Programming Language.


Design
------

This site will utilize D to the fullest extent possible.  
The tech used will include:

* Vibe.d
* MongoDB


The site should use interactivepython.org as a 'guide'.  It is a functional
website that does what we want, just for a different language.

Be on the lookout for anything that is more difficult than it is on IP.org



Tutorials
---------

The formats to be used:

* Markdown 

Unlike many other formats, Markdown provides a good compromise between 
plain-text and postprocessed text.  We will 'pretty-print' the text on page load,
as well as make it available for download.
